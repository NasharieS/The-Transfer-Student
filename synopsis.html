    The story of Amara begins in Philadelphia in 2005. Frustrated by the systemic disparities in her underfunded public school, she watches her teachers fight tirelessly against overcrowded classrooms and shrinking resources. At home, she’s still reeling from the loss of her father, grappling with a strained relationship with her mother, and haunted by recurring nightmares of a past she can’t explain nor control. Amara desperately wants change but feels powerless to make it happen. Until, one morning, everything shifts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Amara never expected to wake up in someone else’s life. But now, in the body of a different student, in a different country with a new school awaiting her, everything changes. She’s thrown into unfamiliar education systems that challenge everything she thought she knew about opportunity, privilege, and the future. As she jumps from student to student, learning what education looks like elsewhere while still being chased by the past, she realizes one truth: the fight for education is bigger than her, and she may be the only one who can change it.
  </p>

  <p>
    But when every attempt at reform back home leads to a dead end, the idea of staying–permanently taking over a body to access a world-class education and a future she could never have–becomes dangerously tempting. Then, the visions start. Glimpses of what lies ahead for public education in the U.S. and the alarming direction it is headed in. Now, Amara faces a choice: Does she return to fight for her little brother and the students she left behind? Or will a system that controls who gets access to knowledge–and who doesn’t–ensure she never makes it home?
