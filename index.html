            <p>
                *The Transfer Student* follows Amara, a student who discovers she has the ability 
                to witness the past and glimpse the future of education across the globe. 
                As she navigates different school systems and societies, she realizes that 
                learning is more than just a classroom—it's a battleground for justice.
